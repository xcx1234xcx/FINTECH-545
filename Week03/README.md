# Week 3 Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for the Week 3 Project, which involves simulation and comparison of covariance matrix methods, along with data analysis tasks related to Positive Semi-Definite (PSD) matrices.

## Project Structure

- **`Week 3 Project.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook file containing the code and explanations for the project tasks.
- **`DailyReturn.csv`**: A dataset file used for some of the data analysis (ensure this file is placed in the same directory as the notebook).

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you will need the following Python libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scipy
- statsmodels

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Week 3 Project.ipynb`.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run each code cell sequentially and perform the analyses.
