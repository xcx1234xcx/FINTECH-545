# Week 4 Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for the Week 4 Project, which focuses on simulating different price evolution models using Monte Carlo methods. The project includes comparison of Classical Brownian Motion, Arithmetic Return Systems, and Geometric Brownian Motion.

## Project Structure

- **`Week 4 Project.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook file containing the code and simulations for the project tasks.
- **`DailyPrices.csv`**: The dataset used for part of the data analysis, though most of the tasks rely on Monte Carlo simulations.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you will need the following Python libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scipy
- statsmodels

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Week 4 Project.ipynb`.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run each code cell sequentially and perform the analyses.
